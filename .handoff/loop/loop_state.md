status: ACTIVE (resumed) 2026-06-13 @ 2/3 — cycle 3 TASK-0004 DONE (PR #47), cycle 4 TASK-0002 DONE
  (PR stacked on #47). FINDING-0002 RESOLVED (Option A; kernel fleet verbs, meta/handoff #17). Epic A
  Tier-A seed landed git-text-only (capsule refresh + OPTIONAL hooks/policies/skills + rendered
  packet via `hf fleet render envctl`; 0 per-repo ledger, hf fleet status P7-clean). Next pick:
  **Epic A TASK-0003** (p7-conformance CI gate + `hf sync` `.kb` GO-LIVE, run at $META_ROOT) — natural
  follow-on — or **Epic C TASK-0012** (crates/agent-env, large, fresh context). Budget 2/3: ONE more
  cycle then HAND OFF. Resume via `/forge-loop resume`; reset cycles to 0.

## Progress log
- cycle 1 (2026-06-13, TASK-0001, PASS-WITH-NOTES): built+installed `hf` from meta/handoff
  (`~/.local/bin/hf` → release symlink); `hf --help` runs; residency guard clean (shared ledger
  only, read-only). Dormant Stop/PreCompact hook now LIVE (resolves hf, runs from $META_ROOT,
  exit 0, no per-repo ledger). Witnessed-event WRITE is a no-op until a task is active → defers to
  TASK-0002 (correct dep). CARRIED FINDING: hf kernel links bundled C SQLite (rusqlite/
  libsqlite3-sys via the `ledger` crate) — not an envctl no-c violation (separate workspace) but
  flagged against Epic A's pure-Rust-kernel north star.

- cycle 2 (2026-06-13, TASK-0002 + TASK-0003, BLOCKED/NEEDS-DECISION): source-proved that the
  shipped `hf` is strictly CWD-relative (no `--ledger`/`HANDOFF_DIR`), so envctl's Tier-A
  text/packet layer cannot be hf-rendered against the shared meta ledger without creating a
  forbidden per-repo `ledger.db` (ADR-0004). `mint --from-kb` needs CWD=child-repo; `hf seed`
  writes the kernel's own HFTASK cards. Fix is a kernel feature in `meta/handoff` (out of envctl
  scope). Wrote `.handoff/decisions/FINDING-0002-...md` (3 options, A recommended). TASK-0003
  blocked with it (depends on a seeded layer). Epic A stalls pending the owner/kernel decision.

- cycle 3 (2026-06-13, TASK-0004, DONE — resume session): FIRST re-checked FINDING-0002 per owner
  "check now" → RESOLVED. The installed `hf` now exposes `fleet status`, `fleet render MEMBER`, and
  standalone `sync [--auto] [--dry-run]` (kernel meta/handoff PR #17, HEAD 1adbb13; binary rebuilt
  04:29). Verified live from $META_ROOT: `hf fleet status` (fleet ledger present, 64 members),
  `hf fleet render envctl` (wrote packets/latest.md — probe artifact removed), `hf sync --dry-run`.
  Marked TASK-0002/0003 UNBLOCKED. Then implemented TASK-0004: top-level `env` block
  (META_ROOT/META_FILE) in `home/.claude/settings.json.tmpl`, re-rendered `settings.json`, added the
  `settings_json_matches_rendered_tmpl_no_drift` Rust drift guard. Gate: build 395 crates,
  `cargo test -p envctl` 7 pass, no-c/shape/enable PASS. (Pre-existing, out-of-scope: clippy
  `items_after_test_module` on crates/cli/src/main.rs — present on develop, not gated by CI.)

- cycle 4 (2026-06-13, TASK-0002, DONE — resume session, stacked on #47): seeded envctl `.handoff`
  Tier-A as **git-text only** per ADR-0004 §7 (kernel-source verified that `hf init`/`hf seed` would
  plant a per-repo `ledger.db`/irrelevant HFTASK cards — avoided). Refreshed `context/capsule.json`
  next_command; seeded OPTIONAL `hooks/hooks.toml` + `policies/rules.toml` +
  `skills/session-resume.skill.md` from the design-bundle templates (with a `$META_ROOT`-residency
  header); **compiled** `packets/latest.md` via `hf fleet render envctl` (not hand-written); fixed
  `.handoff/README.md` (FLEET ledger = `meta/.handoff/ledger.db`; member packets via `hf fleet
  render`; active loop). Residency: 0 `*.db` under `.handoff`, `.gitignore` guard present, `hf fleet
  status` P7-clean for envctl. Gates: no-c/shape/enable PASS; drift test green. `tasks/` left empty
  (no kb task docs to `hf task mint --from-kb` yet) → tracked under TASK-0003.

## Next safe step
- **Epic A Tier-A seed landed.** Next pick = **TASK-0003 (P1, Epic A)**: add the `p7-conformance` CI
  gate (validate capsule/policy/task schemas + `hf resume --json` → `handoff.packet.v2`; assert no
  per-repo `ledger.db` tracked) AND the `hf sync` `.kb` GO-LIVE (one-way write-back, run at
  `$META_ROOT`/orchestration home — NEVER in-member, which would create a ledger). Natural follow-on.
- Alt: **Epic C TASK-0012 (P0)** — new pure-Rust crate `crates/agent-env` (6-key+extends model,
  multi-host resolver, SHA-256, lock; drop `mimalloc`; no-c clean). Large; gates TASK-0013..0018.
  Route `feature-architect` → `rust-implementer` → `invariant-guardian`. Benefits from fresh context.
- **Budget: 2/3 cycles this session — ONE more cycle, then HAND OFF** (session-relay) and reset to 0.

## Order (dependency-aware; cards own ordering once TASK-0002 mints them)
Epic A: TASK-0001 (build hf) -> TASK-0002 (seed Tier-A + mint cards) -> TASK-0003 (p7 gate).
Epic C: TASK-0012 (crates/agent-env) gates TASK-0013..0018.
Epic B: TASK-0005 healed (settings tmpl on develop); TASK-0008 meta-mcp (proof) before others.
SUPERVISED (never auto-run): TASK-0010 was `- [!!]` (now DONE by a human session — see backlog).

## Gates (non-negotiable)
- never-downgrade (sync meta source UP first) · archive-first (never delete) · build+verify before
  swap · rollback on failure · ledger-residency ($META_ROOT only, no per-repo ledger.db) ·
  packets-rendered-never-hand-written · `- [!!]` items refuse auto-run -> NEEDS-HUMAN.

## needs_human / supervised
- Decision: bring GitKB into meta as a `.meta.yaml` project (git-kb currently external)?
- Old dashboard-forge-loop GUI smoke-test (loop/_done/, HUMAN-ONLY).
- REVIEW (Epic A): hf kernel links bundled C SQLite (rusqlite). If the continuity kernel must be
  C-free under the agenticOS "no C in trust boundary" north star, that's a kernel-side change in
  `meta/handoff` (port `ledger` off rusqlite to pure-Rust) — out of envctl's no-c gate scope today.
