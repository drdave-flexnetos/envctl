cycles_total: 9
last_item: TASK-0012 (crates/agent-env, kasetto absorption) — IN PROGRESS via /harness:rust-port; PR #71
status: HANDING OFF 2026-06-13 (resume session, 1 cycle done; clean early boundary, token economy).
  Cycle 9 = TASK-0012 kickoff: owner authorized the no-downgrade fork → synced meta/kasetto source UP to
  pivoshenko v3.2.0 (divergence archived on flexnetos-divergence-backup-2026-06-13); seeded
  crates/agent-env + ported model/* (foundational + 21-agent table + MCP/command formats), 78 tests +
  no-c GREEN; **PR #71 → develop, auto-merge armed**. TASK-0012 is now driven by the rust-port
  parity-ledger loop (55 [~] / 44 [ ] / 13 [≠] / 0 [x]) — NOT done until 100% parity.
  **Resume the PORT** via `/harness:rust-port` (HANDOFF: `.handoff/loop/rust-port/HANDOFF.md`); the
  forge-loop itself resumes via `/forge-loop resume` (next forge pick after TASK-0012 lands: TASK-0013
  engine wiring, or another Epic). OWNER FOLLOW-UP: kasetto FORK origin/main force-push (see backlog TASK-0012 note).

## Progress log
- cycle 1 (2026-06-13, TASK-0001, PASS-WITH-NOTES): built+installed `hf` from meta/handoff
  (`~/.local/bin/hf` → release symlink); `hf --help` runs; residency guard clean (shared ledger
  only, read-only). Dormant Stop/PreCompact hook now LIVE (resolves hf, runs from $META_ROOT,
  exit 0, no per-repo ledger). Witnessed-event WRITE is a no-op until a task is active → defers to
  TASK-0002 (correct dep). CARRIED FINDING: hf kernel links bundled C SQLite (rusqlite/
  libsqlite3-sys via the `ledger` crate) — not an envctl no-c violation (separate workspace) but
  flagged against Epic A's pure-Rust-kernel north star.

- cycle 2 (2026-06-13, TASK-0002 + TASK-0003, BLOCKED/NEEDS-DECISION): source-proved that the
  shipped `hf` is strictly CWD-relative (no `--ledger`/`HANDOFF_DIR`), so envctl's Tier-A
  text/packet layer cannot be hf-rendered against the shared meta ledger without creating a
  forbidden per-repo `ledger.db` (ADR-0004). `mint --from-kb` needs CWD=child-repo; `hf seed`
  writes the kernel's own HFTASK cards. Fix is a kernel feature in `meta/handoff` (out of envctl
  scope). Wrote `.handoff/decisions/FINDING-0002-...md` (3 options, A recommended). TASK-0003
  blocked with it (depends on a seeded layer). Epic A stalls pending the owner/kernel decision.

- cycle 3 (2026-06-13, TASK-0004, DONE — resume session): FIRST re-checked FINDING-0002 per owner
  "check now" → RESOLVED. The installed `hf` now exposes `fleet status`, `fleet render MEMBER`, and
  standalone `sync [--auto] [--dry-run]` (kernel meta/handoff PR #17, HEAD 1adbb13; binary rebuilt
  04:29). Verified live from $META_ROOT: `hf fleet status` (fleet ledger present, 64 members),
  `hf fleet render envctl` (wrote packets/latest.md — probe artifact removed), `hf sync --dry-run`.
  Marked TASK-0002/0003 UNBLOCKED. Then implemented TASK-0004: top-level `env` block
  (META_ROOT/META_FILE) in `home/.claude/settings.json.tmpl`, re-rendered `settings.json`, added the
  `settings_json_matches_rendered_tmpl_no_drift` Rust drift guard. Gate: build 395 crates,
  `cargo test -p envctl` 7 pass, no-c/shape/enable PASS. (Pre-existing, out-of-scope: clippy
  `items_after_test_module` on crates/cli/src/main.rs — present on develop, not gated by CI.)

- cycle 4 (2026-06-13, TASK-0002, DONE — resume session, stacked on #47): seeded envctl `.handoff`
  Tier-A as **git-text only** per ADR-0004 §7 (kernel-source verified that `hf init`/`hf seed` would
  plant a per-repo `ledger.db`/irrelevant HFTASK cards — avoided). Refreshed `context/capsule.json`
  next_command; seeded OPTIONAL `hooks/hooks.toml` + `policies/rules.toml` +
  `skills/session-resume.skill.md` from the design-bundle templates (with a `$META_ROOT`-residency
  header); **compiled** `packets/latest.md` via `hf fleet render envctl` (not hand-written); fixed
  `.handoff/README.md` (FLEET ledger = `meta/.handoff/ledger.db`; member packets via `hf fleet
  render`; active loop). Residency: 0 `*.db` under `.handoff`, `.gitignore` guard present, `hf fleet
  status` P7-clean for envctl. Gates: no-c/shape/enable PASS; drift test green. `tasks/` left empty
  (no kb task docs to `hf task mint --from-kb` yet) → tracked under TASK-0003.

- cycle 5 (2026-06-13, continuity merge-dup repair, DONE — owner "pick what's next; verify not
  claimed"): the concurrent three-way merge of #47 (TASK-0004) + #48 (a parallel session's
  FINDING-0002 unblock) + #49 (TASK-0002 seed) onto develop=6617ed9 **silently concatenated** the
  continuity files instead of conflicting: `loop_state.md` header TRIPLICATED, `backlog.md` had a
  duplicate TASK-0002 (`[x]` + stale `[ ]`) and TASK-0003 (two fragments), `FINDING-0002` had two
  `Status:` lines. Reconciled all three to a single coherent state (git-text only): one cycle-5
  header; one TASK-0002 `[x]` + one TASK-0003 `[ ]` (GO-LIVE + card-minting folded in); one
  FINDING-0002 RESOLVED status (preserved the `000e4c0`/FLEET_GUIDE detail). Verified-not-claimed
  first: 0 open PRs, 0 remote feature branches, grit `.grit/` empty, FLEET ledger 0 events.

- cycle 6 (2026-06-13, TASK-0003 p7-conformance gate, DONE — owner "Epic A, proceed"): added
  `ci/gates/p7.sh` — a fail-closed, dependency-free grep gate (mirrors `ci/gates/{shape,enable}.sh`)
  that validates the COMMITTED `.handoff/` Tier-A: schema tags (capsule v1 / policy v1 / hooks v1 /
  task v1 / packet **v2**) + ledger residency (no tracked OR on-disk `*.db` under `.handoff`, and the
  `.gitignore` guard present). Deliberately runs NO ledger-mutating `hf` verb in-member (would itself
  create a ledger). Wired into HANDOFF verify-on-resume + CLAUDE.md gate list. Verified: positive PASS
  on the seeded Tier-A; negatives (stray `*.db`, broken packet/capsule schema) fail closed (exit 1).
  Split the `hf sync` `.kb` GO-LIVE + envctl card-minting into new **TASK-0024** (need `$META_ROOT`
  execution / kb task docs). Verified-not-claimed: only unrelated PR #53 (libsql-baton-fix) open.

## Next safe step
- **TASK-0003 gate landed.** Next pick = **TASK-0024 (P2, Epic A)** — the `hf sync` `.kb` GO-LIVE
  (one-way write-back, run at `$META_ROOT`/orchestration home — NEVER in-member) + envctl card-minting
  once kb task docs exist. Smaller, but needs `$META_ROOT`-context execution.
- Alt: **Epic C TASK-0012 (P0)** — new pure-Rust crate `crates/agent-env` (6-key+extends model,
  multi-host resolver, SHA-256, lock; drop `mimalloc`; no-c clean). Large; gates TASK-0013..0018.
  Route `feature-architect` → `rust-implementer` → `invariant-guardian`. Benefits from fresh context.
- **Budget: 1/3 cycles this session.** Can take 2 more before HAND OFF.

## Order (dependency-aware; cards own ordering once TASK-0002 mints them)
Epic A: TASK-0001 (build hf) -> TASK-0002 (seed Tier-A + mint cards) -> TASK-0003 (p7 gate).
Epic C: TASK-0012 (crates/agent-env) gates TASK-0013..0018.
Epic B: TASK-0005 healed (settings tmpl on develop); TASK-0008 meta-mcp (proof) before others.
SUPERVISED (never auto-run): TASK-0010 was `- [!!]` (now DONE by a human session — see backlog).

## Gates (non-negotiable)
- never-downgrade (sync meta source UP first) · archive-first (never delete) · build+verify before
  swap · rollback on failure · ledger-residency ($META_ROOT only, no per-repo ledger.db) ·
  packets-rendered-never-hand-written · `- [!!]` items refuse auto-run -> NEEDS-HUMAN.

## needs_human / supervised
- Decision: bring GitKB into meta as a `.meta.yaml` project (git-kb currently external)?
- Old dashboard-forge-loop GUI smoke-test (loop/_done/, HUMAN-ONLY).
- REVIEW (Epic A): hf kernel links bundled C SQLite (rusqlite). If the continuity kernel must be
  C-free under the agenticOS "no C in trust boundary" north star, that's a kernel-side change in
  `meta/handoff` (port `ledger` off rusqlite to pure-Rust) — out of envctl's no-c gate scope today.
